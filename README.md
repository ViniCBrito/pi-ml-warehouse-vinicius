## Installation and Usage

Use the given Maven Wrapper and Docker to build a new service container 

```bash
## 1. Clone project to local 
git clone https://github.com/Grupo9-ITBootcampMeli/pi-ml-warehouse

## 2. Use Maven Wrapper to generate a new build  
./mvnw clean package

## 2.1. Optionally, build without tests 
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests

## 3. Start service via Docker 
docker-compose up

## 3.1. If you are recreating a container, build a new Docker image and delete the previous
docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d && docker rmi -f $(docker images -f "dangling=true" -q)

```

For full operation, it is necessary to have the [Gandalf](https://github.com/Grupo9-ITBootcampMeli/pi-ml-gandalf) and the [Products](https://github.com/Grupo9-ITBootcampMeli/pi-ml-products) services running with their default ports, hostnames in the same network.
Also, Warehouse service is required for full operation of the [Cart](https://github.com/Grupo9-ITBootcampMeli/pi-ml-cart) service.
